#Mid term Project#
I am making a website to test my skills as a **css** and **html** coder. I chose Starbucks Coffee shop as my company. The reason I chose this company is because I felt it was a place everyone everyone was familiar with. I also sit down and work on schoolwork and art at starbucks because it's quiet and has coffee..
Hopefully making this website can help better understand all the things I have learned these past weeks by using all these pieces of information together in one project.
